Task 4: Personal Security Audit

4A

  1. My scan shows 6 devices, 5 of which I'm aware of but i'm not sure what the 6th is if I understood the scan correctly.
  2. I dont think I have any ports open that shouldnt be
  3. I dont see reported vulnerabilities if they should be easily visible in the output

  1. For my current "main" email there are no breaches. However my first email that I input stupidly everywhere as a kid shows different results :)

  3. After growing up a little and realising how insecure my 1st email was I changed and unlinked whatever accounts I remembered to the email. I never noticed any suspicious use of the breached email though.
